# Sorting Suite

This project challenged me to implement and test four fundamental sorting algorithms: 

1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Merge Sort
4. Quick Sort

## 1. Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)

## 2. Insertion Sort

Insertion sort works by adding items to a sorted array. Typically sorting is done in place inside the array which needs sorting. The first element in the array becomes the sorted array. We iterate through the set to be sorted, pulling one element at a time, then inserting it into its correct position in the sorted section of the array.

# 3. Merge Sort

Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows:

Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element (a list of 1 element is considered sorted).
Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list. Soucre: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)

# 4. Quick Sort

Quicksort is a comparison sort, meaning that it can sort items of any type for which a "less-than" relation (formally, a total order) is defined. In efficient implementations it is not a stable sort, meaning that the relative order of equal sort items is not preserved. Quicksort can operate in-place on an array, requiring small additional amounts of memory to perform the sorting. Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)
